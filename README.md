## 💡 The Problem

Every day, drivers waste **30+ minutes** circling parking lots — burning fuel, wasting time, and causing traffic congestion. There had to be a smarter way.

## ✅ The Solution — SmartPark

**SmartPark** is a real-time IoT smart parking system that lets users **see**, **book**, and **access** parking slots from their phone — before they even arrive.

No more guessing. No more waiting. Just park.

## 🛠️ Built With
```
ESP32 × 2  •  LoRa Ra-02 433MHz  •  IR Sensors  •  Servo Motor  •  Adafruit IO  •  MQTT
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
```
🔍 IR Sensor detects car
        ↓
📡 ESP32 TX sends data via LoRa
        ↓
📶 ESP32 RX receives & pushes to cloud
        ↓
📊 Adafruit IO dashboard updates live
        ↓
👆 User books slot from dashboard
        ↓
🚧 Servo gate opens automatically
```

Simple. Fast. Smart.

## 📊 Live Dashboard (Adafruit IO)

The dashboard gives you **3 powerful feeds:**

- 🟢 `parking-status` — Which slots are free right now
- 🔖 `booking-status` — Manage your reservation
- ⚙️ `servo-angle` — Gate control (automatic)

---

## 🧰 Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukesh2311/SmartPark-IoT.git
```

1. Open `TX_Node.ino` → Upload to **ESP32 #1**
2. Open `RX_Node.ino` → Add your WiFi & Adafruit credentials → Upload to **ESP32 #2**
3. Open your **Adafruit IO dashboard**
4. Watch it work live ✅
